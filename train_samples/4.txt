I am heavily experienced in back-end architect and development using different PHP frameworks, SQL/NoSQL storages and many other technologies. Last project tech stack: Laravel, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Redis, RabbitMQ, Docker, Linux (advanced user/administrator). I appreciate all the modern technologies helping to make nice solutions - flexible, extensible, effective, up to the available resources.

Paying a lot of attention to the code accuracy. Have a huge experience of code investigation, optimization and refactoring of bad-formed legacy code. Good at testing and documentation writing.

Experienced in Agile development methods and other useful practices for effective team work. Like to use my large experience to optimize workflow to increase team productivity. I can quickly understand and take in the business demands and realize how to satisfy them. After all, I know how to build a good team to get the work real. Have good Scrum Master skills.

My favorite activities are program architecture development, problems analysis and solutions. Happy to explore new useful technologies. Like to dive into complex problems to make proper decisions: which storage is the best for the whole solution, which libraries suit the business expectations, what the rest the team needs to code to get the stuff working. And at the same time be sure everything will work as it required, and even more if we need that.

Prefer to work with complex (and nicely built!) systems instead of plenty of simple isolated projects. At the same time I know how to split those complex systems into simple components and make them effective and easy to handle.

Before I focused on web I had some experience with C++ application development.

Fluent spoken English, average spoken Spanish.

Open-minded and creative person. High communication skills.
